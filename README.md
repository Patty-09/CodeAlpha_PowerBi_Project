# CodeAlpha_PowerBi_Project
Power BI Dashboards – Finance &amp; Real Estate Includes two interactive dashboards: • Financial Health – Tracks income, balance sheets, cash flows, and forecasts. • Real Estate Trends – Analyzes property prices, rental yields, and market hotspots
This dashboard was created during my Power BI internship with CodeAlpha, where I worked on real-world datasets to build interactive business intelligence solutions.
